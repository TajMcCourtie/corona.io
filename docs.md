# Corona.io

This project is to setup a php website that will allow users to login to the site. Once the user is logged in all pages visited will have the user first name displayed at the top of the pages. 

If the user is unable to login then they will not be able to continue. 

## Site Architect
The site will be broken up into two sections.
```
> Internal Codes 
   - Login class >>> oh
   - Signup class >>> tm
   - AutoClassLoader class >>> oh
   - Session script >>> tm
   - error script >>> tm
   - log script >>> oh

> User Interface
   - index.php >>> tm
   - login.php >>> oh
   - signup.php >>> tm
   
```
Please see tasked assigned, your free to change the files you wish to work with.
