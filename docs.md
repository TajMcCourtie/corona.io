# Corona.io

This project is to setup a php website that will allow users to login to the site. Once the user is logged in all pages visited will have the user first name displayed at the top of the pages. 

If the user is unable to login then they will not be able to continue. 

## Site Architect
The site will be broken up into two sections.
```
> Internal Codes 
   - Login class >>> oh
   - AutoClassLoader class >>> oh
   - log script >>> oh

   - Signup class >>> tm   
   - Session script >>> tm
   - error script >>> tm
  

> User Interface
   - login.php >>> oh

   - index.php >>> tm   
   - signup.php >>> tm
   
```
